      What is the relationship between the U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI and the Federal PKI?
    </button>
    <div id="b3" class="usa-accordion-content">
      The Federal Government currently manages the Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI), a trust framework of over one hundred (100) certification authorities used to issue and manage person identity and enterprise device identity certificates for the U.S. Federal Government and mission partners. The current Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI) is managed and operated as a bridged public key infrastructure originally intended to establish trust across related communities of interest.
	  <br><br>
	  Government teams recognized the need to create a new Certificate Policy and infrastructure focused on Internet PKI requirements. The CAs operating under this Certificate Policy in this new infrastructure will not have cross-certificates with any existing Federal Public Key Infrastructure CAs. This is one step towards new purpose driven services intended to support the mission needs, and:
	  <br>
	  <ul>
		<li>Separate the certificate policies and infrastructures</li>
		<li>Delineate person identity, government enterprise device identity, government code signing, government time stamping, and public trust (Internet) web services</li>
		<li>Support automation for the missions</li>
		<li>Improve customer experience and public transparency for Federal Government public web services</li>
	  </ul>
	  <br>
	  The FPKI Policy Authority maintains the governance and voting rights to manage this Certificate Policy.
