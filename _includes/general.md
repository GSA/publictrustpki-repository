      What is the U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI?
    </button>
    <div id="a1" class="usa-accordion-content">
	  The U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI was developed to address Internet PKI requirements established to protect consumers, protect website operators from spoofing incidents, and promote an open and transparent trust model across the globe. 
	  <br><br>
	  Internet PKI requirements include:
	  <ul>
		<li>Requiring Certificate Transparency (CT)</li>
		<li>Requiring increasingly shorter lifetimes of the validity of certificates used for publicly trusted web services</li>
		<li>Public disclosure of all certificate policies, practices and procedures by all Certification Authorities</li>
	  </ul>
	  The U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI meets the requirements above by issuing publicly trusted TLS certificates to Federal .gov and .mil web services in accordance with recognized standards, such as the <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements/" target="_blank">CA Browser Forum Baseline Requirements</a>.

      What is HTTPS and why is it important?
    </button>
    <div id="a2" class="usa-accordion-content">
      HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol that gives users a level of security and privacy when connecting to websites and web services.
	  <br><br>
	  The internet's fundamental design means that both visitors and website owners have very little control over where communications will travel, or whose devices will carry that communication. To ensure secure communication across the internet, traffic must be encrypted all the way from visitors' devices to the website owners' devices -- and that's exactly what HTTPS does. Without HTTPS, hostile networks can inject malware or tracking beacons, or otherwise monitor or change visitor interactions online.
	  <br><br>
	  Without HTTPS, website visitors have no guarantees about what happens as they browse the web. Without HTTPS, a visitor's communication with a website can be modified or monitored by anyone or anything "between" them and the website they're visiting. The attacker could be someone using that coffee shop WiFi (or the coffee shop itself), or it could be someone who's hacked an old, out-of-date load balancer which website traffic is flowing through on its way around the internet.
